		"long_description": "EPA’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption\" target=\"_blank\">Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program</a> (EDSP) evaluates chemicals for potential endocrine disruption and there are thousands of chemicals of interest to the program, which make up the EDSP Universe of Chemicals. EPA researchers developed the EDSP Universe of Chemicals Dashboard to provide access to chemical data on over 1,800 chemicals of interest.\r\nThe purpose of the EDSP Dashboard is to help the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program evaluate chemicals for endocrine-related activity. The data for this version of the Dashboard comes from various sources:<br/><br/>\r\n•\tRapid, automated (or in vitro high-throughput) chemical screening data generated by the EPA’s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) project and the federal Toxicity Testing in the 21st century (Tox21) collaboration.<br/>\r\n•\tChemical exposure data and prediction models (ExpoCastDB).<br/>\r\n•\tHigh quality chemical structures and annotations (DSSTox).<br/>\r\n•\tPhyschem Properties Database (PhysChemDB).<br/><br/>\r\nThe Dashboard displays bioassay information, bioactivity concentrations, estrogen and androgen receptor (ER and AR) model results, predicted physicochemical properties, and more. Current chemical and bioassay data can be accessed at <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data</a> . Published ER (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26272952\" target=\"_blank\">PMID 26272952</a>) and AR (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27933809\" target=\"_blank\">PMID 27933809</a>) model results are available for citation.<br/><br/>\r\nWhen using the Dashboard, keep in mind:<br/><br/>\r\n•\tThe activity of a chemical in a specific assay does not necessarily mean that it will cause toxicity or an adverse health outcome. There are many factors that determine whether a chemical will cause a specific adverse health outcome. Careful review is required to determine the use of the data in a particular decision context.<br/>\r\n•\tInterpretation of ToxCast data is expected to change over time as both the science and analytical methods improve.<br/>\r\n•\tAdditional substances that are not part of the EDSP’s statutory authority are included since they are relevant to EPA’s ongoing work on the validation of the endocrine and androgen bioactivity models.<br/><br/>\r\nEPA will continuously update chemicals on the EDSP Dashboard to include as much relevant information on chemicals in the EDSP <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/endocrine-disruptor-screening-program-edsp-universe-chemicals\" target=\"_blank\">Universe of Chemicals</a> as possible. Some “EDSP Universe of Chemicals” do not have bioactivity information in the EDSP Dashboard because of the incompatibility of some chemicals to be tested in ToxCast (e.g., chemical too volatile, chemical not soluble in DMSO, etc.). <br/><br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/edspuoc\" target=\"_blank\">list of the EDSP Universe of Chemicals</a> contains approximately 10,000 chemicals, as defined under FFDCA and SDWA 1996 amendments. \r\nThe Agency has also added test data on as many chemicals as possible to the EDSP Dashboard that were on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-first-list-chemicals-tier-1-screening-under-endocrine-disruptor\" target=\"_blank\">EDSP List 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-second-list-chemicals-tier-1-screening-under-endocrine-disruptor\" target=\"_blank\">EDSP List 2</a>:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/edsp21list1\" target=\"_blank\">EDSP List 1</a>: The list of chemicals for initial EDSP Tier 1 Screening under the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program includes chemicals that the Agency, in its discretion, decided should be tested first, based upon exposure potential.

Information about what types of substances are on the TSCA inventory can be found here. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, requires EPA to designate chemical substances on the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory as either “active” or “inactive” in U.S. commerce. To accomplish this, EPA finalized a rule requiring industry reporting of chemicals manufactured (including imported) or processed in the U.S.. This reporting is used to identify which chemical substances on the TSCA Inventory are active in U.S. commerce and help inform the prioritization of chemicals for risk evaluation. The list contained in the dashboard includes the active TSCA inventory based on notifications through Feb. 7th 2018 and substances reported from Feb 8, 2018 – March 30, 2018 that have been unambiguously mapped to DSSTox using CASRN and chemical names. The curation of the non-confidential portion of active TSCA inventory is an ongoing process involving trained chemists to validate the correctness of DSSTox structural and identifier data. The content of the list will change over time as the non-confidential active TSCA inventory is updated and more substances are curated. (Updated March 19th 2019)",

The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA's ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA's ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs.

The network model uses activity patterns across the in vitro assays to predict whether a chemical is an ER agonist or antagonist, or is otherwise influencing the assays through a manner dependent on the physics and chemistry of the technology platform (“assay interference”). The method is applied to a library of 1812 commercial and environmental chemicals, including 45 ER positive and negative reference chemicals. ",

The NTP contribution was drawn from the NTP bioassay and research testing programs of chemicals of interest to environmental toxicology, and the NCATS contribution consisted primarily of marketed drugs.

		"long_description": "The focus of the T3DB is on providing mechanisms of toxicity and target proteins for each toxin. This dual nature of the T3DB, in which toxin and toxin target records are interactively linked in both directions, makes it unique from existing databases. It is both modelled after and closely linked to the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and DrugBank. Potential applications of T3DB include toxin metabolism prediction, toxin/drug interaction prediction, and general toxin hazard awareness by the public, making it applicable to various fields. ",
