There are solutions at the bottom of the hierarchy of controls. Sometimes that action is using the chemical wearing gloves or with extra ventilation. ChemHAT was designed to let us ask and answer a different question. Instead of what engineering controls and personal protective equipment do I need to lower the levels of exposure to a “safe” level, ChemHAT is being designed to answer the question, “Is there a way to get this job done without using dangerous chemicals?
