This assay endpoint, TOX21_ERa_LUC_VM7_Agonist, was analyzed in the positive fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity.  Using a type of inducible reporter, gain-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the reporter gene as they relate to the gene ESR1.  Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint. To generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the nuclear receptor intended target family, where the subfamily is steroidal.",
